# football-score-prediction
This is a machine learning project I did as a research assignment for the course "TDAT3025 Applied Machine Learning with project" at NTNU. The aim was to predict future football results with various machine learning techniques based on statistics from previuos games.

## Install Dependencies
The following packages needs to be installed to reproduce this project:

1. Python
2. Matplotlib
3. Numpy
4. Pandas
5. Scikit-learn
6. torch

You should be able to quickly install all requirements by running the following line in your terminal/console:
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
If this does not work try installing each package individually.

## Get started
To reproduce the analysis and research results, do the following steps:
1. Run dataprocessor.py - downloads and processes the data to be used:
```bash
cd data
python3 dataprocessor.py
```
